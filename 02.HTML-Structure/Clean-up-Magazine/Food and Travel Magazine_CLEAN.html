                <p>
                    Nine years ago we set out to create a unique series of awards. We wanted to impartially identify the very best in the business, judged by experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote. These experts had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by Food and Travel readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now is your chance to give credit where it’s due by submitting your nominations. Whether it’s a chef whose dishes you recently tried and can’t stop thinking about or a cookbook that has become indispensable when entertaining, an outstanding cruise line or a warmly welcoming B&amp;B, now’s the time to give your travel and food heroes the recognition they deserve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You must be registered and logged in to vote in the 2020 awards. During the first round, you may submit up to three nominations for each category. These suggestions will together form the shortlist, to be published in the June/July edition of Food and Travel. Voting will then commence.
